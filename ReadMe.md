StreamPlayer is a FFmpeg-based .NET control for playing video streams. The control uses a frame grabber under the hood, so if you need just frames and no UI, then take a look at the control's sources for a reference on how to use the frame grabber.  

The control is simple and easy to use, has no additional dependencies and a minimalistic interface.
